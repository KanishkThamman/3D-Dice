# 3D Dice Roller

## Description

This project is an interactive 3D dice roller implemented using Three.js for 3D rendering and Cannon.js for physics simulation. It provides a realistic dice rolling experience in a web browser, complete with 3D graphics and accurate physics.

## Features

- 3D rendered die with textured faces
- Realistic physics simulation for dice rolling
- Interactive roll button to initiate dice rolls
- Dynamic camera that follows the die
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Three.js (3D graphics library)
- Cannon.js (Physics engine)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/KanishkThamman/3D-Dice
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd 3D-Dice
```

3. Open `index.html` in a web browser.

## Usage

1. Open the application in a web browser.
2. Click the "Roll Dice" button to roll the die.
3. Watch as the die rolls and settles based on realistic physics.
4. The number on the top face of the die after it settles is your roll result.

## Customization

- To change the appearance of the die, replace the texture images in the `textures` folder.
- Adjust the physics parameters in the JavaScript code to modify the rolling behavior.
- Modify the CSS to change the layout and styling of the page.
